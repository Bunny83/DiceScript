* Die.cs
* 
* This is a general purpose dice script. It should be attached to a die object
* and allows you to define the different sides of the die in the inspector and
* SceneView. Each "side normal" should point upwards when the corresponding
* side should be "active". For a "d4" (tetrahedron) you may want to use the
* "flip" function on each normal after you defined the normals of the opposite
* sides / faces.
